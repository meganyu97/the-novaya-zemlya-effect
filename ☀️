“Oh shit, look, the sun!” - Gerrit de Veer, 1597. More or less. 
In the arctic, winters bring forward a period of six to seven weeks of pure darkness. 
The whiteness of darkness extends scale 
when the silence is deafening. 
Expeditioners’ minds were racked by Mother Nature
When their exact calculations of when life would resume again
Would be preceded by sights of the sun
Weeks ahead of time 
She had men tripping over their silly scientific claims to testosterone 
Before the patriarchy could assume the position
In reality, she had in her arsenal, 
The boreal phenomenon
Where the frigid air meets the warmth of the atmosphere
and creates a polar mirage
Reflecting the image of the sun
Before it rises over the horizon
Almost as if Mother Nature wants to tell you
In the isolated darkness you sit frozen in, 
Light will be there soon.
The Novaya Zemlya Effect.
